    "\n",
    "3. **Launch VSCode from Terminal:**\n",
    "   - Open your terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS/Linux).\n",

    "   - `code`: When you type `code` in the terminal and press Enter, it will launch Visual Studio Code, but without specifying any directory or file to open. This means VSCode will open with a blank workspace, and you will have to manually open a folder or file from within the VSCode interface.\n",

    "\n",
    "5. **Opening VSCode in a Directory:**\n",
    "   - Opening VSCode in a directory means setting that directory as the \"workspace\" for the VSCode session. A workspace in VSCode is essentially a project context that allows you to group related files together and configure workspace-specific settings.\n",
    "   - When you open VSCode in a directory, all the files and subdirectories within that directory become part of the workspace, enabling you to work on those files collectively.\n",
    "   - This is helpful when you are working on a specific project because it allows you to access the project's files, manage extensions, and apply specific configurations unique to that project.\n",
