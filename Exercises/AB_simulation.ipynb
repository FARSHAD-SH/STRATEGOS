    "# üìå Overview of the Exercise: Strategic Budget Allocation Simulation\n",
    "This exercise models a **strategic expenditure system** where two competing entities (e.g., companies, governments, players) allocate budgets over time based on predefined rules. Their expenditures depend on **fatigue, reaction to competitors, ambition, and initial investments**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each iteration updates their budgets dynamically using an equation that factors in their **own fatigue**, their **reaction to their competitor‚Äôs spending**, and their **ambition level**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üìñ Mathematical Formulation\n",
    "This simulation follows a **discrete-time iterative process**, where at each step, we update the expenditures for two players: **A (Alpha)** and **B (Beta)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Expenditure Update Equation\n",
    "At each step, the expenditure of each entity is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "E_A(t) = A_{\\text{Ambition}} - A_{\\text{Fatigue}} \\cdot A_{\\text{Budget}} + A_{\\text{Reaction}} \\cdot B_{\\text{Budget}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "E_B(t) = B_{\\text{Ambition}} - B_{\\text{Fatigue}} \\cdot B_{\\text{Budget}} + B_{\\text{Reaction}} \\cdot A_{\\text{Budget}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $E_A, E_B$ are the updated expenditures.\n",
    "- $A_{\\text{Ambition}}, B_{\\text{Ambition}}$ represent motivation for spending.\n",
    "- $A_{\\text{Fatigue}}, B_{\\text{Fatigue}}$ represent diminishing returns of spending.\n",
    "- $A_{\\text{Reaction}}, B_{\\text{Reaction}}$ capture reaction to competitors‚Äô spending.\n",
    "- $A_{\\text{Budget}}, B_{\\text{Budget}}$ are the current budgets before updating.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Maximum Expenditure Constraint\n",
    "If an entity‚Äôs expenditure exceeds its **maximum allowed budget**, a penalty is applied:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "E_A = E_A - 3 \\times A_{\\text{Fatigue}} \\times A_{\\text{Budget}}, \\quad \\text{if } E_A > A_{\\text{Maximum}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "E_B = E_B - 3 \\times B_{\\text{Fatigue}} \\times B_{\\text{Budget}}, \\quad \\text{if } E_B > B_{\\text{Maximum}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This rule **limits excessive spending** to prevent the budgets from growing indefinitely.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Iterative Budget Updates\n",
    "At each time step $t$, the new budgets for the next iteration are set:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "A_{\\text{Budget}}(t+1) = E_A(t), \\quad B_{\\text{Budget}}(t+1) = E_B(t)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $t$ is the iteration step.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows us to **simulate dynamic competition** over multiple rounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üîé Conceptual Explanation\n",
    "This model **mimics real-world competitive spending scenarios**, such as:\n",
    "- **Two companies competing in marketing and R&D.**\n",
    "- **Two governments allocating defense budgets based on each other's strategies.**\n",
    "- **Two political parties adjusting campaign expenditures.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Each player **adjusts their spending dynamically**, considering:\n",
    "1. Their own **motivation** (Ambition).\n",
    "2. The **exhaustion effect** (Fatigue).\n",
    "3. The **reaction to their competitor‚Äôs spending** (Reaction).\n",
    "4. A **maximum cap on expenditure** to prevent runaway spending.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üìä Visualization of the Results\n",
    "1. **Plot of Expenditure Over Time:**  \n",
    "   - **X-axis:** Iteration (time step).  \n",
    "   - **Y-axis:** Expenditure.  \n",
    "   - **Two lines:** One for **A (Alpha)**, one for **B (Beta)**.  \n",
    "   - **Dashed line for Beta (B) to distinguish it visually**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Interactive Widgets:**\n",
    "   - Adjust **initial budgets** and **parameters** to see how the competition unfolds dynamically.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üí° Key Takeaways\n",
    "- This simulation **models real-world decision-making** in competitive environments.\n",
    "- The **budget dynamics evolve based on past behaviors** (iterative updates).\n",
    "- A **maximum limit prevents unbounded growth**.\n",
    "- Players **react to each other's expenditures** over time.\n"
